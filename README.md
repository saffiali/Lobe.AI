# What is Lobe?
Lobe is a free client app that helps any user to bring machine learning ideas into reality. Just show it examples of what you want it to learn, and it automatically trains a custom machine learning model that can be shipped to your app. You can also export those models to be used on any platform.

Lobe currently supports Image Classification, with Object Detection and Data Classification coming soon.

 

Lobe vs. Cognitive Services
While Lobe targets most users, Cognitive Services aims for developers with no/limited machine-learning expertise. All it takes is an API call to embed the ability to see, hear, speak, search, understand and accelerate decision-making into your apps.

Cognitive Services can be trained on the cloud or locally, while Lobe can currently only train locally and data must also be local on the userâ€™s computer.

Collaboration is also an issue for Lobe as it is single use. Cognitive Services is a cloud service that has a robust collaboration and security around data and training.
